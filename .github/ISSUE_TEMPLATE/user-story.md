### Slide 3: Spinning Process

**Step-by-Step Spinning Process:**

1. **Blow Room:** Opening and cleaning of raw fibers.
2. **Carding:** Aligning fibers to form a thin web.
3. **Drawing:** Combining and straightening slivers.
4. **Roving:** Slight twisting to prepare fibers for spinning.
5. **Spinning:** Final twisting to produce yarn.
6. **Winding:** Preparing yarn packages for subsequent processes.

**Key Technologies:** Modern spinning frames, automatic winders, and electronic quality monitors.
